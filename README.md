This code demonstrates a Q-learning agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The agent learns to play the game by updating a Q-table based on the rewards it receives after each move. Below are some enhancements and corrections to make the code more robust and efficient:

1. **Initialize Q-values Correctly**: When initializing Q-values for a new state, ensure that it uses a consistent shape. Instead of `np.zeros((3, 3))`, use a flat array or dictionary for flexibility.
2. **Add Learning Rate Decay**: Decaying the learning rate over time can improve convergence.
3. **Fix the Next State Update**: Ensure the `next_state` is correctly updated after every action.
4. **Handling Exploration Rate**: The exploration rate should decay but not fall below a certain threshold to ensure ongoing exploration.
5. **Play Against the Agent**: The human vs. agent game should ensure correct state transitions and updates.

Here is the enhanced version of your code:

```

In this code:

- **Q-table Initialization**: Q-values for new states are initialized with a shape of (3, 3).
- **Exploration Decay**: The exploration rate decays gradually but stays above a minimum threshold to ensure continued exploration.
- **Next State Handling**: The next state is correctly handled and updated.
- **Interactive Play**: Allows a human player to play against the trained agent.

This should help the agent learn effectively and play Tic-Tac-Toe more robustly.
